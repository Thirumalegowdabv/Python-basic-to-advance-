#variables are used to store data , it acts like a container where it stores data
#variables namse should not start with capital letter and case sensitive

#name = "thoja"
#age = 39
#print(name,age)

#expressions like a+b , a-b etc

#comments which are part of program but does not perform execution 
#after the # symbol what we write is comments 

#indentation is the key in python language we should be aware of it 

#datatypes

#strings = set of instructions
#int = numbers, ex 10
#float = decimal numbers, ex 0.3
#ex "hello" here hello is a string

#name = "thoja"
#print(isinstance(name,str)) => here we are checking about the type of the thoja that is it string or not 

#we can convert one datatype to another datatype by using class constructor 
#ex let a = 9(intger number) and lets convert it into float 
#age=9
#age=float(9)
#print(isinstance(age,float)) #in the output we get its a float

#this is called casting 

#num="test"
#box=int(num)
#print(isinstance(box,int)) #here we get error because we can not convert non-numeric string to and other 

#num = "20"
#one = int(num)
#print(isinstance(one,int)) #here we get output as true because there is conversion from string to int because numeric string can be converted 

#other datatypes are 

#complex for complex numbers
# bool for boolean 
# list for lists
# tuple for tuples
# range for ranges
# dict for dictionaries
# set for sets
