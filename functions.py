# enums are the readable names which are bound to constants values
# to use this enums we need import it from standard enum libraray

# from enum import Enum

# class Student(Enum):
#     BEST = 0
#     AVERAGE = 1
    
# print(Student.BEST.value)   , output = 0
# print(Student["BEST"].value) , output = 0
# print(Student(1))   , output = Student.AVERAGE
# print(list(Student))    it lists the  values of the Student

# user inputs 
# here we learn about how can a user can give inputs manually that is inside a program and outside a porgram(compilation)

#  it can be implemented by using user input() function

# print("what is your age?")
# age=input()                , in this line we give input in the terminal 
# print("your age is :" + age) , here we get the output like your age is 30

# other way 

# age=input("what is your age?")        
# print("your age is :" + age)   ,   same output but here inorder to get the output we need enter our age first then we will get your age is 30
